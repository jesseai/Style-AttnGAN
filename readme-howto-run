It is necessary to have an input feature tensor, 

to get this you may copy 
	Style-AttnGAN/output/textEncoderStates/out_working_feature_tensor.json
to
	Style-AttnGAN/output/textEncoderStates/in_working_feature_tensor.json

The web interface also does this on save.





The simplest way to run this, is to use the run.sh script, with your input words:

run.sh 'blue green'

Note the number of words is 2, it is not possible to mix different quanties of words in
	out_working_feature_tensor.json
and
	in_working_feature_tensor.json

They must be the same size.
